  - Welcome to my seafood restaurant, newbie!
  - "Your job's pretty simple, buddy. When customers arrive, <b><color=red>just hit
    E</color></b> to take their order. And when I\u2019m done cooking their food,
    <b><color=red>smash that E again</color></b> to deliver it to them like a hero. "
  - 'Careful, okay? The last guy working here <b><color=red>held down F</color></b>
    to dump salt all over the food. Worse, he even <b><color=red>held G</color></b>
    to toss a mouse in the dish. '
  - "<b><color=orange>My reputation bar</color></b> at the bottom right of the screen
    went straight to trash because of him. <b><color=red>My anger bar</color></b>
    maxed out, so I kicked him out. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got this job now.
    Don\u2019t mess it up. "
