# 🔥 Let Him Cook

👨‍🍳 **Genre:** Simulation – Strategy – Stealth Cooking

## 🕹️ Detailed Description

In **Let Him Cook**, you play as a waiter in a seafood restaurant. However, unlike a normal waiter, your mission is to become a **silent saboteur**, seeking revenge for your brother who was kicked out by the harsh Chef. Secretly sabotage customers’ dishes by adding excessive salt or dropping mice into their food to ruin the restaurant’s reputation.

⚠️ **But be careful** – your every move is under the strict watch of the Chef.

### 🎯 Your Goal
